How to implement bigint using ubigint

a s+ b:
   if both signs same
      then
         call a u+ b
      else
         compare the values
         if a bigger than b
            then a u- b
            else b u- a
         sign of result is sign of bigger value

a s- b:
   if signs are different
      then
         call a u+ b
      else
         if a bigger than b
            then a u- b
            else b u- a
         sign is same as bigger number

"bigger" means larger ubigint value
u+ and u- refer to ubigint operators
s+ and s- are bigint operators

Other notes:
. the size of 0 is always POSITIVE
. 0 is represented as a vector of 0 size (empty)
